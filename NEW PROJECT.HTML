            <H1>On <u> March 31, 1909</u>, some three months after work began on the Olympic, the keel was laid for the Titanic.
                 The two ships were built side by side in a specially constructed gantry that could accommodate their unprecedented size. 
                 The sister ships were largely designed by <U>Thomas Andrews</U> of Harland and<U>wolff</U> . In addition to ornate decorations,
      the Titanic featured an immense first-class dining saloon, four elevators, and a swimming pool. Its second-class accommodations were comparable to first-class features on other ships,
          and its third-class offerings, although modest, were still noted for their relative comfort.</H1>
          <H1>As to safety elements, the Titanic had 16 compartments that included doors which could be closed from the bridge,
               so that water could be contained in the event the hull was breached. Although they were presumed to be watertight,
                the bulkheads were not capped at the top. The ship’s builders claimed that four of the compartments could be flooded without endangering the liner’s buoyancy.
               The system led many to claim that the Titanic was unsinkable.</H1>

               <H1>Following completion of the hull and main superstructure, the Titanic was launched on <u>May 31, 1911. </u> 
                   It then began the fitting-out phase, as machinery was loaded into the ship and interior work began.
                    After the Olympic’s maiden voyage in <u>June 1911</u>, slight changes were made to the Titanic’s design.
                   In early <u>April 1912</u> the Titanic underwent its sea trials, after which the ship was declared seaworthy.</H1>
