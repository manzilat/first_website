                       <a href="./NEW PROJECT.HTML"> The Titanic</a> was supposed to be an unsinkable boat and it was built to monumental scale. In total,
                     it was 882.5 feet long,
                     92.5 feet wide, and 175 feet high. It would displace 66,000 tons of water and it was the largest ship built up to that point in time.


                    The Queen Mary cruise ship was built in 1934 and surpassed the Titanic's length by 136 feet, making it 1,019 feet long.
                     In comparison, The Oasis of the Seas, a luxury liner built in 2010,
                      has a total length of 1,187 feet. That is nearly a football field longer than the Titanic<BR>
                        Luxuries for the first class passengers included a swimming pool, a Turkish bath, a squash court and a dog kennel.
                         The Ritz Restaurant on board was inspired by the famous Ritz in London's Picadilly Circus.
                          The grand staircase—there were several staircases—on the Titanic descended seven of the ship's ten decks,
                      and featured oak paneling and bronze cherubs. A replica of the staircase can be see at the Titanic museum in Branson, Missouri.</H2>

            <P><H2>The Titanic burned about 600 tons of coal each day to keep it powered.
                 A team of 176 men kept the fires burning, and it is estimated that over 100
                  tons of ash were injected into the Atlantic each day the Titanic operated.</H2></P>

                  <P><H2>
                        Originally, a lifeboat drill was scheduled to take place on board the Titanic on the very day that the ship hit the iceberg.
                         However, for an unknown reason, 
                        Captain Smith canceled the drill. Many people believe that had the drill taken place, more lives could have been saved.

                  <P><H2>
                        Not only were there not enough lifeboats to save all 2,200 people on board, most of the lifeboats that were launched were not filled to capacity. 
                        If they had been, 1,178 people might have been rescued, far more than the 705 who did survive.

                        For instance, the first lifeboat to launch—Lifeboat 7 from the starboard side—only carried 24 people,
                         despite having a capacity of 65 (two additional people later transferred onto it from Lifeboat 5).
                         However, it was Lifeboat 1 that carried the fewest people. It had only seven crew and five passengers 
                         (a total of 12 people) despite having a capacity for 40.

            When the Titanic began sending out distress signals, the Californian, rather than the Carpathia, was the closest ship. However, the Californian did not respond until it was much too late to help.

            At 12:45 a.m. on April 15, 1912, crew members on the Californian saw mysterious lights in the sky.
             These were the distress flares sent up from the Titanic and they immediately woke up their captain to tell him. Unfortunately, the captain issued no orders.
            
            Since the ship's wireless operator had already gone to bed as well, the Californian was unaware of any distress signals from the Titanic until the morning.
             By then, the Carpathia had already picked up all of the survivors. 
            Many people believe that if the Californian had responded to the Titanic's pleas for help, many more lives could have been saved.
